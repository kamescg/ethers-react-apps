# Applicaiton Boilerplate Overview

The decentralized applications (besides the `ethers-react-app-barebones` application) are non-trivial decentralized application boilerplate. The boilerplate's include routing (`reach-router`), flexible design system (`theme-ui`) and other modules which are used in a large percentage of modern React applications.

A consistent file structure is used across all the boilerplates, so it's easier to drag-and-drop functionality simply by copying and pasting components from one project to another.

The `ethers-react-app-barebones` demo application has no opinionated project setup and is a fresh `create-react-app` with `yarn eject` run and the `ethers-react` modules added as dependenices.
